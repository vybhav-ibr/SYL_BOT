# SYL_BOT
This Project was made using Java, this project solves Syllogism questions. The GUI is made using swing library. 
It uses all the avialable rules to find if one or more conclusions can be drawn from the given statements,

The 'GUI.java' file contains the main exicution of the program, the 'base.java' has the defenitions and functions of the Classes and methods used in the 'GUI.java'. Make sure to keep both the files in the same project folder.

There are still a lot of features to be added, I will keep working on them.
# Fell free to go through the source code and contribute.
